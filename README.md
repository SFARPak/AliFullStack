# 🧠 AliFullStack — AI-Powered Full-Stack App Builder (Local-First, Open Source)

**AliFullStack** is a blazing-fast, **AI-driven Full-Stack App Builder** that runs entirely **locally** — giving you total **data privacy**, **vendor freedom**, and powerful **LLM integration**. Whether you're a solo indie hacker, startup, or enterprise developer, AliFullStack helps you **build, test, and deploy apps autonomously** using your favorite frontend and backend frameworks.

> ✅ 100% Local | 🚀 LLM-Powered | 🧠 BYO AI API Key | 🧩 Framework-Agnostic | 💡 Open Source

Inspired by tools like _Lovable_, _v0.dev_, and _Bolt_, but with no lock-in or cloud dependency. Built on top of [Dyad](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad), AliFullStack gives you the power of AI without sacrificing control.

  ```

### Testing

- **Run unit tests:**

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- **Run E2E tests:**

  First, build the app for testing:

  ```sh
  npm run pre:e2e
  ```

  Then run the tests:

  ```sh
  npm run e2e
  ```

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```sh
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit:**

   ```sh
   git add .
